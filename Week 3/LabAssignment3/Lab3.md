## Lab 3: ¡NLTK y spaCy!

**Goals:** 1) Adapt and modify the NLTK and spaCy notebooks to process new data. 2) compare results and models available for these NLP libraries

You will learn how to:
- modify Jupyter notebooks
- run Jupyter notebooks with your data

#### Suggestions: work in couples if necessary and adapt the notebooks covered during class. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need help. Tutorial to solve any issues on Tuesday 7/20 - 10-11am. Enjoy!

### Task 1: Comparing frequency profiles of two datasets with NLTK <br/>
Instructions:
1. Create a new Colab Notebook
2. Rename the file like this: LastNameNLTK.ipynb
3. Choose two datasets from different language levels (Materials folder)
4. Run the NLTK module and create a frequency profile of unigrams and bigrams
5. Leave comments throughout the notebook of what you are doing
6. Decide whether to filter 'stopwords' or not. Leave your reasoning.
7. Create plots for the 20 most common unigrams and 10 most common bigrams.
8. Create a frequency profile for trigrams
9. Write a brief discussion and conclusion of your comparison.


### Task 2: Compare the accuracy of the four Spanish models available for spaCy <br/>

Instructions:
1. Create a new Colab Notebook
2. Rename the file like this: LastNamespaCy.ipynb
3. Load the other Spanish models found here: [Modelos](https://spacy.io/models/es)
4. Test the accuracy of the 4 Spanish Models: Use sentences from students compositions or come up with your own
5. Write a brief discussions of the results: Was there a Spanish model that performed more accurate?

#### What to submit?
1. a notebook for the NLTK practice: LastNameNLTK.ipynb
2. a notebook for the spaCy practice: LastNamespaCy.ipynb
