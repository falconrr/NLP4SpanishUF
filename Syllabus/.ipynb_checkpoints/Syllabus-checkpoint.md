# Natural Language Processing for Spanish
**Summer 2021 – Dr. Falcon Restrepo-Ramos  <br />
Department of Spanish and Portuguese Studies, University of Florida**

This course is an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies and their application to the linguistic analysis of Spanish texts. The course provides a survey of current technologies that are used in the field of computational linguistics while using Spanish for the application of NLP tools. The class is designed to allow you to gradually develop simple programming skills in Linux/Mac command line and Python for text processing that will allow you to learn a set of 21st century skills in NLP in high demand for your future career choice in academia or industry.

The course will have three general components. **First**, the basic practical skills for text processing in Linux/Mac command line and Python will be introduced using Spanish texts. The basics of programming will be assigned via two free online courses in *LinkedIn Learning* and with in-class exercises. These basic aspects of programming will be necessary for installing and running the NLP applications.
**Next**, the class will delve into the *Python Natural Language Toolkit* (NLTK) and *spaCy*, two libraries used for common NLP tasks (e.g., sentence segmentation, word tokenization, dependency parsing, sentiment analysis, named-entity recognition, and text classification). **Finally**, you will work towards extracting and creating your own annotated corpus of Spanish. Here you will learn how to extract Spanish data from *Twitter*. With the annotated corpus you will develop and train a simple machine learning classifier.  

## Course Objectives
On completion of the course, you should be able to:
-	feel comfortable using Linux/Mac command line for text processing
-	conduct basic coding in Python and use Jupyter Notebook (an interactive computational environment for language programming).
-	display a familiarization with NLTK and spaCy and comprehend how they are applied for NLP tasks
-	create your own annotated corpus of Spanish for specific purposes
-	be able to conceptualize a solution for an NLP application
-	look beyond academia as a potential career path

Student success relating to these objectives will be assessed on (tentative and subject to revision):
-	**Lab assignments**: These assignments will require you to implement already-prepared computational algorithms on Spanish datasets and explore potential improvements and applications.  
-	**NLP Proposal**: you will write a brief proposal about a research project in which you will be using NLP applications. Think about how different NLP tools and approaches can boost your work and be useful for your own research. Bear in mind the use of UF supercomputing resources (HyperGator).
-	 **Course project**: you will extract a Spanish corpus for developing an NLP application. The project consists of two parts. First, you will create an annotated dataset of Spanish. Then, you will present to the class the development of your own machine learning classifier:
    1. topic classification: classify a text based on a topic or relevance
    2. sentiment anaysis: detect positive, negative or neutral sentiment in a text.
    3. intent classification: classification based on the purpose of the illocutionary act: complaint, request, feedback, etc.

## Programming Component on LinkedIn Learning
As a UF student you have free access to LinkedIn Learning. The following are two courses on the platform that are strongly suggested for you to take before we begin our second week of the course:

LinkedIn Learning: [LinkedIn Learning](https://elearning.ufl.edu/supported-services/linkedin-learning/)
- Python Essential Training by Bill Weinman (Course takes around 5 hours) [Python Essential](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2). This course will introduce you to Python programming language, the most popular programming language for NLP. Work at your own pace and complete as many modules as you want.
- Introducing Jupyter by Josh McQuiston (Course takes around 1 hour) [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introducing-jupyter/). Jupyter notebook is an interactive environment for Python.  

## Extraction of Twitter Corpora
On Week 4, we will learn to extract Twitter corpora for our project. Please register as a researcher in advance for obtaining access to Twitter API.
- Twitter Developer API: [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api)

#### Other Corpora
Alternative corpora resources.
-	CEDEL 2 Corpus: corpus de aprendices del español: [Cedel Corpus](http://cedel2.learnercorpora.com/)
- Corpus del español: [Corpus del Español](https://www.corpusdelespanol.org/x.asp)
- Corpus PRESEEA: [Preseea](https://preseea.linguas.net/Corpus.aspx)
